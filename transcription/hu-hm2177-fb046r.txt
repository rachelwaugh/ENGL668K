With what truth I may say
Roma Roma Roma
Non e puis come era prima (no longer as it was before)
My lost William, thou in whom
Some bright spirit lived and did
That decaying robe consume
Which its history (?) ??? hid
I ??? it is find a tomb
. . . these lines. If those not die
Rest thy bones . . . then is a shrine
Where art thou my gentle child
Something, something living words
Let me think thy spirit feels
