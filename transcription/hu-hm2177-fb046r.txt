With what truth I may say
Roma Roma Roma
Non e puis come era prima (no longer as it was before)
My lost William, thou in whom
Some bright spirit lived and did
That decaying robe consume
Which its history faintly hid
[-Too often they unwind-]
I ??? it is find a tomb
That be
[-under-]neath this pyramid
[-Dig they graves. If those not die-]
Rest thy bones . . . then is a shrine
Where art thou my gentle child [-lay-]
[-Dignified other living words-]
Let me 
[-whose childe I-] think thy spirit feels
Within its [???] interior mild
The [-g??? living-] love of living [-flower-] saves
among these tombs of ruins wild
[-could I believe that-]
Originality does not consist
??? words ?? ??? or str??
or combinations of mind &
language different from ???
Which have you ?? it
does not consist only if ??
